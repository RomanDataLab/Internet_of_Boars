# Internet of Boars
## Research of options for coexistence of wild animals with humans within anthropocene landscapes. </br>
Reda Petravičiūtė, Christos Grapas, Roman Pomazan</br>
Research is aimed at identifying lines of conflict between humans and wild boars, diagnosing its preconditions and development, and proposing ways for reconciliation. </br>
tools: Grasshopper (Rhinoceros 3d 7), Hops, EarthEngine, Geojson, Circuitscape, QGIS, illustrator, Photoshop, Urbano.
## What I learned: 
- Data mining with Earth Engine and Hops plugin for Grasshopper.
- Data vizualisation of predicted tracing of migration of wild animals.
- Methods of bibliographic analysis.
- Map vizualisation with Grasshopper using Hops plugin, CORINE Land Cover CLC 2018 from the Earth Engine Data Catalog.
- Methods of overlappind map data with Grasshopper and QGIS.
## Key takeaways
- We live in the Anthropocene, when humans have colonized all landscapes and deprived animals of their natural habitats, forcing them to move into "special" natural reserve zones.
- Natural reserve zones are often disconnected, obstructing animals from migrating.
- Very often natural landscapes are segmentated by linear infrastructure, industrial and agricultural patches.
- In contrast, animals are attracted to rich-for-food urbanized areas, and the more they find urban food, the more they are transforming into urban animals, especially this rule applies to the boar.
- Wild animals invide urban landscapes for food search from segmentated natural habitats, that is perceived by humans as agression and often causes an [urgent negative reaction] (https://www.theanimalreader.com/2022/08/17/news-barcelona-kills-wild-boars-to-protect-humans/)
- the most invaded-by-animals areas correlate with the most prosperous neighborhoods
- several options to resolve the conflict: connection of natural landscapes by wildcrossings, seasonal animal rights for the city, collaboration of permaculture farms and animals
  
## methodology
1. overlapping data and merging maps with Grasshoper. [source>>](221104_AXO_CONNECTIVITY_LANDUSES_Roman ed02.gh)
2. generating animal migration.[source>>](221024_Barcelona_Resistance_3D.gh)
3. parametric scheme [source>>](stakeholder scheme connection.gh)
